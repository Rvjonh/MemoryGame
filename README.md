Here you will find a model of the popular memory game.

## Why did I create this game?

My inspiration was to practice a little bit Javascript vanilla, this project was one of the first that I complete. And now it's on live, I wanted to recreate the animation of flip a card, so I didn't just acomplish that, but a entire memory game.

## Characteristics

Play the memory game through clicking on a play button and:

* The score will be display base on the pairs of cards you have choosen.
* You have to check the all of the pairs of cards you win the game.
* Your time will be timed and will be displayed when the game ends.
* Your Tries will be counted.
* At the end these points will show a summary of your game.

Clicking on floating 🔩 button, you will see different options to change the dynamics of the game.

* Enable or Disable the sounds in the game.
* Select how many pairs of cards you want to play with.
* Changing the back color of cards in an unique color or use linear gradient to create an unique style of 2 to 5 color.
* Select the type of card you want to play with, availables:

    1. Emojis [😁😎😋🤣😃].
    2. Letters [A,B,C,D,E,F].
    3. Numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].

## Development

You are totally free to use the code, you just need let me know, I will be glab if someone found it useful.

to add more features or edit the project, you just need the folder and start coding.
I recommen to use a code editor. it's a beginner project so, there is just primary files.
